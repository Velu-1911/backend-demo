	2.model which describes all the data in the backend table (the getters setters and constructor).
	3.service:- which describes all the operations performed on the backend(It is only a interface it only defines the functions not write any code inside the function. )
	4.Service Implementation:- which implememts the service interface and performs all the functionalities in the backend.
	5.controller :- Here we will create  the rest API which will use all the components(here we write a lot of concepts we don't understand).
	controller also accepts the data and communicate with the front end
